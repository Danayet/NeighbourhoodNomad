//The Plan
//Add a new drop-down list component on click of filter button
  //add filter button back in âœ…
  //create handleclick function so when clicked renders drop-down list
    //inside handleclick update clicked state to be true 
  //create a conditional render so when clicked is set to true drop-down list component is rendered

//Click on filter item (e.g. activity-type = food&drink)
  //sub-title activity-type
  //list of filter options (ability to select multiple)
    //food&drink
    //entertainment
    //exercise
//once filter item selected, re-render grid with filtered list
  //handleclick function that is called when checkbox is clicked (checked === true)
    //inside handle click function map over array of objects to search for matches where
    //filter condition is a match (activity-type="food&drink")
    //return filtered array
    //set currentFilter state to be the filtered array
  //pass filtered array to map function within grid so that only newly filtered list is rendered.
    //create a state called currentFilter which stores value of currently filtered array
    //pass that state to the map function which renders the grid
//once filter de-selected, re-render grid with unfiltered list
