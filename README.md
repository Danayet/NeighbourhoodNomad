# NeighbourhoodNomad


Welcome to the NeighbourhoodNomad project! This project was developed as part of the School of Code bootcamp, where a team of six individuals collaborated to create a unique and innovative application within a tight timeframe of five weeks.

# About the Project
The project focused on the development of a platform that bridges the gap between travelers and locals by providing curated guides based on users' interests. From conceptualization and research to planning, development, and deployment, we utilized a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) to bring this idea to life.

Front-end: React.js
Back-end: Express.js, Node.js
